These public repositories are bioinformatics projects developed at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Parasitology [(WCIP)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/wcip/). They contain either standalone software for recurrent analyses or custom code for research projects. 

There are also a number of private repositories for unpublished, work-in-progress research.
